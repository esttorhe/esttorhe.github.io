          Hi; my name is <strong>Esteban Torres</strong> and I'm an <code>Engineering Manager</code> @ <a href="https://spotify.com">Spotify</a> in Berlin & currently working on <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com">Backstage</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm originally from Costa Rica where I started as an <code>Engineer</code> and quickly jumped on the <code>iOS</code> bandwagon; this led me to land a job as an <code>iOS</code> Engineer @ <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> which of course led to me & my family moving to Germany.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time at <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> I wore many hats:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>iOS</code> Engineer (<code>Listening Cluster</code> and later on <code>Core Clients</code>)</li>
          <li><code>Cross Platform</code> Engineer (<code>Core Clients</code> where I got to do <code>Scala</code>, <code>Go</code>, some <code>Production Engineering</code>, <code>iOS</code> & <code>Android</code> development, etc)</li>
          <li>And most recently <code>Engineering Management</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I used to be moderately active in the <code>iOS</code> community and tried to attend different conferences (as an attendee as well as a speaker) but since I switched careers I slowed down a lot on that front.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's been a few years since I started working as an <code>Engineering Manager</code> and lots of things have happened:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Managed to help a former member of my team transition to a different team where they could grow even more and exert a bigger and wider impact</li>
          <li>Had to manage one of the biggest projects the company (<code>SoundCloud</code>) had seen, involving multiple teams, contractors and all 3 major clients</li>
          <li>Took over a 2nd team, which focuses mainly on <code>Back End Engineering Productivity</code></li>
          <li>Switched jobs and landed an amazing one working closely with OSS</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It is fair to say I'm still figuring out things on the new role, but the day-to-day has changed from "I have no idea what I am doing" to "I have no idea what I am doing, but I've seen this before". Looking forward to growing more on this new chapter, although I haven't stopped coding, mainly in <code>Go</code> and very recently started learning <code>Rust</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been jotting down what I learn in a good old paper notebook which I'll try to migrate to a more modern place in this website.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/esttorhe">GitHub</a> and <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@esttorhe">Mastodon</a> as <code>@esttorhe</code>.
