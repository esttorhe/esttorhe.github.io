It's a «well known» fact that I'm trying to get to 12% body fat; last year I was really close at 14% but then I ricocheted back to 17% and my mental state took a toll and was not able to get back on track. I've been going up & down on my body fat since then.

Last December I hit horrible numbers because I pretty much gave up on exercising and dieting.

Then I wrote [this article](/2014/12/new-year-resolutions/) about my resolutions for 2015 and here's an almost up to date [repo](https://github.com/esttorhe/2015-Resolutions) where I'm keeping track of my accomplishments.

As you can see I'm going pretty well with my resolutions (as soon as I publish this post I'll hit the mark at 500 public contributions) but I'm kind of stumbling with my fitness goal.

«Inspired» (for a lack of a better word) by [Amanda Cerny's 21 day gym challenge](https://www.facebook.com/MissAmandaCerny/photos/a.131955946897595.28409.100344450058745/868664193226763/) I decided to do the same to try and get back on the fitness train.

## The theory

All this `21 days` challenge is because [there's a theory](http://www.quora.com/Does-it-really-take-21-days-to-break-a-habit) that states that 21 days is how long it takes to make or break a habit.

Perhaps its true, maybe not; but I've found that some consistency does help me get back to a mindset when I'm not motivated enough.

## That's it

And basically that's it; I'm trying to go 21 days doing exercise and following my diet exactly, letter by letter to try and get back on track.

I created a repo where I'm going to be tracking each day and whether or not I exercised or followed my diet.

*Note: worth noting that my gym doesn't open on Sundays; which means that maybe I won't workout on Sundays and just don't count that day or maybe I'll just jog 15 minutes or so; haven't decided yet.*
