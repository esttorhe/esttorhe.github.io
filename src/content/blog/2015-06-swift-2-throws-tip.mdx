## Quick `Swift 2.0` `throws` tip:

There's been __*a lot*__ of «heated» debates regarding the `throws` approach added to `Swift 2.0` in favor of `Either<T,U>`.

Some examples:

  @cocoaphony Throws types were explicitly but hand-wavily pooh-poohed in the What's New in Swift talk :/

  I would trade throws for sum types with pattern matching in a heartbeat. #swift

That being said, I'm not going to convince you to use it or avoid it. That's entirely up to you, the app / framework you are working on and whether or not you need to do async calls with `throws` (which is a «fun» thing to accomplish).

If you end up using the `throws` approach though there's a big issue along the lines of «What is this function supposed to `throw` at me?»

And while this tip won't «solve» the issue at compile time is sure a nice way to «notify» the consumers of your `API` somehow.

My approach so far was to add the following to the header of the apple doc of my functions:

```swift
/**
Do something nice here.

- parameter dragon: 🐉

- returns: A rainbow 🌈

- throws `CustomError`: Thrown when a unicorn is born.
*/
public func winTheInternet(dragon: Dragon) throws -> Rainbow { …
```

This will turn into something like this:

## Take away

As you can see this is not a «perfect» solution but is at least a great way of providing documentation for your callers as part of your internal documentation.

Happy documentation!
