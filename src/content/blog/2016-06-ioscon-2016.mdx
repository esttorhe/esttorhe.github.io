![iOScon 2016 Speakers](http://res.cloudinary.com/skillsmatter/image/upload/v1461926676/ioscon_speakers_collage_nxn8qm.jpg)

Last week I had the chance to travel from Costa Rica all the way to London to speak at my first international conference: [iOScon 2016](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7598-ioscon-2016-the-conference-for-ios-and-swift-developers)

I had the opportunity to share with a lot of **GREAT** developers and more so to make new friends.

My talk was: [MVVM + RxSwift + DataControllers](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7863-mvvm-rxswift-and-datacontrollers) and I think it went pretty well.

Here are the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/esttorhe/mvvm-plus-rxswift-plus-datacontrollers).

There are still things to improve but overall received good feedback and I **REALLY** enjoyed the experience.

## Travelling

The trip was *SUPER* exhausting to say the least; spent most of the days and nights light headed and trying to fight «jet-lag» but it was such a great experience.

## What I learned

### Approaches to speaking

I was able to witness first hand different styles of presenting a talk; as Marin told me and I wholeheartedly agree, talks that are given from a personal perspective are usually the best.

This pretty much means that I'll try to keep giving my talks from a personal perspective and as if I was having a conversation with the attendees rather than just talking out loud (which honestly doesn't seem that great an idea to be honest).

### Nerves?

I was never too «scared» or nervous about the whole talk thing; I've given my fair share of talks (although this was going to be my first international one) but it was somewhat unnerving to think that perhaps the content that I was creating wasn't worth it or that people would get bored.

However as [Agnes](https://twitter.com/vasarhelyia) told me that [Marin](https://twitter.com/icanzilb) told her once:

> «they are in the room, you convinced them already»

I've always thought about that but somehow have forgotten until Agnes reminded me.

### Topics

There's no need for **ONLY** speaking about breakthrough discoveries or great `OSS` projects you have created, etc.

Talking about experiences, even non-technical topics are always great if you so happen to deliver them in a way that the attendees can relate to.

Possibly my next talk won't be a technical talk but rather a mix between half-tech and half-personal experiences.

Surely I'll get to do this again soon.
