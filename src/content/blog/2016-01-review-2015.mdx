Last year I made a [list of resolutions](https://github.com/esttorhe/2015-Resolutions) and also [blogged about it](/2014/12/new-year-resolutions/); overall it was a great year; completed almost all my resolutions and had the chance to grow **A LOT** professionally (or so I think).

A small round down of my previous year:

* Got turned down by [Slack](https://slack.com): Basically applied to Slack and everything went OK but I suck at interviews; I think I don't know how to sell myself properly and was turned down. No hard feelings though, they felt I wasn't a good fit for the team and they got to do what's best for the team.
* Changed jobs: I left [Log(n)](http://logn.co) around September and started working on an AMAZING job beer-related called [Brewbot](http://brewbot.io).
* Travelled to Belfast (new job's HQ are located in Belfast)
* Got to finally meet in person Ash Furrow, Orta, Chris Eidhof, Agnes Vasarhelyi, Veronica Ray among many other great developers.
* Got shortlisted for `SwiftSummit` in San Francisco and even wrote a blog post for them that I think hasn't been published (will probably release it on my blog)
* Started contributing more to open source; helping with [RxViewModel](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/rxswiftcommunity.github.io), [RxSwiftCommunity](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity), [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org), [FBSnapshotTests](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case), [SwiftGen](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen), [SwiftSSH2](https://github.com/esttorhe/SwiftSSH2), [DeckRocket](https://github.com/jpsim/DeckRocket), [XcodeServerSDK](https://github.com/czechboy0/XcodeServerSDK), [NaughtyKeyboard](https://github.com/Palleas/NaughtyKeyboard) and some others which helped me not only learn a lot but to get to know a lot of people from ALL over the world
* Made a lot of Twitter/Internet friends which I think is one of the MOST amazing things from last year; if you are reading this and you are one of my new interwebz friend: hello! Really appreciate being friends with you
* Finally organized a [CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheads.org/cr/SanJose/index.html) meetup :)
* [CraftKollective](http://craftkollective.com) started moving again and we are on the path towards generating business!
* Configured [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) on my website and now is faster and more secure by defaulting to `https`
* Moved to a new house: My girlfriend and I moved to a bigger house, located in a gated community (which is great for when our son starts playing outside with friends) and closer to her family. This is a huge milestone because I wasn't 100% happy with our previous house.
    * On that note we started renting our previous house to a couple of guys that destroyed it and we are now just wanting to sell it and be done with it.
* My son is healthy and super happy! He's a bright kid and that tires us down super fast. It's super cool anyways! He'll be starting school in a couple of weeks; can't wait for all the crazy adventures that will come.

After writing all this and re-reading my resolution's from [last year's post](/2014/12/new-year-resolutions/) I'm more than happy with how everything turned out. I really LOVE my current job and everyone I work with, also I get to write `Swift` all day long and get paid to do it!

All is left for this year is keep pushing my limits; last year one goal was to submit a topic to a conference, did it; this year is to actually ***GIVE*** a talk.

In the horizon there's always the idea to move abroad; we'll see how things pan out.
