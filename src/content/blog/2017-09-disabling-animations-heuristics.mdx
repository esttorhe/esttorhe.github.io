Checking `Twitter` the other day I stumbled upon these tweets from [Sash Zats](https://twitter.com/zats) addressing some heuristics for enabling/disabling intensive animations in `iOS` apps:

  Here's a list of heuristics for disabling heavy animations in iOS apps, feel free to contribute

That definitely resonated in me and made me realised with horror that I have never «bothered» to even consider any of this things before performing intensive blocks of animation.

Below on the thread [Marin Todorov](https://twitter.com/icanzilb) provided a link to this checks added to `RxAnimated` (Here's the link to the specific line of code: [shouldDisableAnimationsViaDefaultHeuristics](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxAnimated/blob/master/RxAnimated/Core/RxAnimated.swift#L95)).

From now on this is something that I'll definitely be doing on my apps and would probably keep updating it as more I find more heuristics to be applied to this check.

*Edit: There isn't much to this blog post other than drawing attention to the heuristics and hopefully raising awareness so more developers start to use them.*
