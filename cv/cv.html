<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<p><strong><code>SoundCloud</code></strong> <em>BackEnd Engineering Productivity Engineering Manager</em> <strong>08.2021 to present</strong><br>
    Focused on scaling up the BackEnd engineering experience, improve productivity and automate best practices, started working on identifying, cataloging and standardising what constitues as Tech Debt in order to properly measure it to be properly tackled.<br>
    Working in tandem to define a global set of syntactic metrics to measure systems and teams and be able to compare and properly priorize depending on what the company and the current goals are.</p>

<h3> </h3>

<p><strong><code>SoundCloud</code></strong> <em>Core Clients Engineering Manager</em> <strong>2019 to present</strong><br>
    Lead the technical front to design, implement and release the very first <code>Design System</code> @ SoundCloud. Leading a cross functional team compromised of 14 engineers, coordinating with 2 designers and distributed accross different countries and timezones. Managed to reduce the time it takes to iterate and test UI/UX changes by 30%.<br>
    Manage a cross platform team involving <code>BackEnd</code> technologies (<code>Scala</code>, <code>Go</code>) as well as <code>Android</code> &amp; <code>iOS</code>. Grew the team to double the number of <code>BackEnd</code> engineers &amp; started the inclusion of <code>Web FrontEnd</code> development to the team.<br>
    Lead many company wide efforts to improve the <code>Engineering Experience</code> across the entire technology organization, e.g.: Centralisation of engineering documentation finding &amp; creation, established a program to share multiplatform work knowledge to other teams, unification of multiple tracking systems to cross-reference on a single place, lead the technical aspect of a redesign project that involved all user facing clients of our app (<code>web</code>, <code>Android</code> &amp; <code>iOS</code>).<br> 
    Focused on leading the career development path of the team, due to the structure of the team more times than none I need to fill the roles of <code>Product Manager</code> as well as <code>Product Owner</code>.</p>

<h3>‚ÄÇ</h3>

<p><strong><code>SoundCloud</code></strong> <em>Core Clients Engineer</em> <strong>2016 to 2019</strong><br>
    Reduced compile times by 7 minutes by the creation of a service side <code>Swift</code> service with a companion <code>Ruby</code> service that tracked build times locally and on <code>CI</code>, which helped us track major bottlenecks that guided us towards improving our project organization; resulting in more developers embracing <code>TDD</code> due to lesser turnaround times which lead to an increase in the confidence of shipping new features.
    Reduced the number of flaky tests on the <code>iOS</code> code base by implementing a <code>Swift</code> server side service that scrapes and parses <code>CI</code> data from <code>Buddybuild</code>, to generate metrics and dashboards that helped us track and fix flaky tests and confirm improvements via metrics; which lead to minimizing friction when adding new features and reducing the integration time by 50% as a result of reducing the need to re-run the <code>CI</code> jobs to verify flakyness.
    Improved initial playback time and playqueue load times by 15 seconds by extracting and refactoring <code>Offline Sync</code> into it&#8217;s own framework and removing unnecessary complexity; leading to an increase in total listening time of our users by 10%.
    Wrote multiple tools that hookup to <code>Prometheus</code> in order to properly analyze and maintain app health as well as to better understand how all the systems interact with each other.<br>
    Architected and defined the infrastructure for modules/framework extractions into micro features.
    Integrated the new in-house media player into the <code>iOS</code> application; leading to less crashes, faster remote media loading and caching as well less fragmentation of the code via guiding all the media playback through the same engine (audio &amp; video).</p>

<h3>‚ÄÇ</h3>

<p><strong><code>Brewbot</code></strong> <em>Lead iOS Developer</em> <strong>2015 to 2016</strong><br>
    Improved app responsiveness and testability by 20% by introducing reactive programming and <code>ViewModel</code> + <code>DataControllers</code> resulting in faster iteration times and an increase in the amount of bugs and new features the team could tackle.
    Streamlined the <code>CI</code> and ¬´delivery¬ª processes by integrating <code>fastlane</code> into the workflow of the organization; guaranteeing increase in confidence with each change by running the tests before every integration and deploying <code>OTA</code> updates; resulting in a more stable application and facilitating the addition of changes.</p>

<h3>‚ÄÇ</h3>

<p><strong><code>Log(n)</code></strong> <em>Mobile Lead Engineer</em> <strong>2012 to 2015</strong><br>
    Defined a structure for the <code>iOS</code> department by being the mobile lead engineer of a small team of 4 mobile engineers which lead to the company to be able to take more projects and reduce the turnaround time.
    Established a development process for <code>iOS</code> projects by documenting and defining a workflow that resulted in a considerable decrease in maintainability times and ability to iterate on new features on the projects.
    Established a CI system for development and delivery by setting up some Mac Minis and Buildasaur with Xcode Bots which resulted in an increment of 15% in test coverage and a reduction of 50% times when deliverying new <code>ipa</code>s.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>SoundCloud</code> Design System</strong>
To improve hypothesis testing and faster iteration in <code>UI</code>/<code>UX</code> efforts; a <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969"><code>Design System</code></a> was design, build and put in place to enable <code>Product Managers</code> and <code>Designers</code> to more easily test changes. Not just that, defining a standard language taxonomy, everyone involved in changes could communicate clearly and without misunderstandings; by sharing the same concepts <code>Designers</code>, <code>Production Managers</code>, <code>Engineers</code> &amp; <code>Engineering Managers</code> could communicate intent and needs and be understood exactly. Plus facilitating fixing issues and improving functionality since changes were centralised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>RxViewModel</code></strong>
<a href="https://github.com/reactivecocoa/reactiveviewmodel"><code>ReactiveViewModel</code></a> <code>Swift</code> implementation for <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift"><code>RxSwift</code></a>. Created to satisfy a lack of a reactive implementation of <code>ViewModel</code> for <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift"><code>RxSwift</code></a>, to better understand the innards of <code>RxSwift</code> and help ease the usage of <code>MVVM</code> with an  <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift"><code>RxSwift</code></a> integration.
It was later transfered to <a href="http://community.rxswift.org/">RxSwiftCommunity</a> to live under the umbrella of the <code>RxSwiftCommunity</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Multiple OSS Projects</code></strong>
Some of the <code>OSS</code> contributions I&#8217;ve worked on are:
<a href="https://github.com/fastlane-old/sigh/pull/7">Added team support to <code>sigh</code> (<code>fastlane</code>&#8217;s tool)</a></br>
<a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/">Added quality index view for a pods in <code>CocoaPods</code>&#8217; website</a></br>
<a href="https://github.com/Moya/Moya/pull/194">Migrated <code>Moya</code> to support <code>Swift</code> 2.0</a></br>
<a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/ios-snapshot-test-case/pull/121">Device agnostic support on <code>FBSnapshotTestCase</code> &amp; <code>Nimble-Snapshot</code></a></p></li>
</ul>
