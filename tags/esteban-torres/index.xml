      <description>Hi; my name is Esteban Torres and I&amp;rsquo;m an Engineering Manager @ SoundCloud, Berlin. I&amp;rsquo;m originally from ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·Costa Rica where I started as an Engineer and quickly jumped on the iOS badwagon; this led me to land a job as an iOS @ SoundCloud which of course led to me &amp;amp; my family moving to ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.
At SoundCloud I&amp;rsquo;ve worn many hats:
 iOS Engineer (Listening Cluster and later on Core Clients) Cross Platform Engineer (Core Clients were I got to do Scala, Go, some Production Engineering, iOS &amp;amp; Android development, etc) And most recently Engineering Management  I used to be moderately active in the iOS community and tried to attend different conferences (as an attendee as well as an speaker) but has since a couple of years slowed down a lot in that front.</description>
