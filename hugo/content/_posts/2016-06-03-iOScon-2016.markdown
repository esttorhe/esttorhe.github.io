![iOScon 2016 Speakers](http://res.cloudinary.com/skillsmatter/image/upload/v1461926676/ioscon_speakers_collage_nxn8qm.jpg)

<!--more-->

Last week I had the chance to travel from Costa Rica all the way to London to speak at my first international conference: [`iOScon 2016`][ioscon]

I had the opportunity to share with a lot of **GREAT** developers and more so to make new friends.

My talk was: [`MVVM + RxSwift + DataControllers`][talk] and I think it went pretty well.

Here are the [slides][slides].

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="7d5ec318cd9744f69818c716a2fc1642" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

There are still things to improve but overall received good feedback and I **REALLY** enjoyed the experience.

## Travelling

The trip was *SUPER* exhausting to say the least; spend most of the days and nights light headed and trying to fight Â«jet-lagÂ» but it was such a great experience.

## What I learned

### Approaches to speaking

I was able to witness first hand different styles of presenting a talk; as Marin told me and I wholeheartedly agree, talks that are given from a personal perspective are usually the best.

This pretty much means that I'll try to keep giving my talks from a personal perspective and as if I was having a conversation with the attendees rather than just talking out loud (which honestly doesn't see that great an idea to be honest) Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

### Nerves?

I was never too Â«scaredÂ» or nervous about the whole talk thing; I've given my fair share of talks (although this was going to be my first international one) but it was somewhat unnerving to think that perhaps the content that I was creating wasn't worth it or that people would get bored.

However as [Agnes][agnes] told me that [Marin][marin] told her once:
>Â«they are in the room, you convinced them alreadyÂ»

I've always thought about that but somehow have forgotten until Agnes reminded me ðŸ˜„

### Topics

There's no need for **ONLY** speaking about breakthrough discoveries or great `OSS` projects you have created, etc.

Talking about experiences, even non-technical topics are always great if you so happen to deliver them in a way that the attendees can relate to.

Possibly my next talk won't be a technical talk but rather a mix between half-tech and half-personal experiences.

Surely I'll get to do this again soon.
