I've got the opportunity to read [Ash Furrow][ash]'s post about his 5 years doing `iOS` development and read (as much as I could from my phone) [Orta][orta]'s blog about his 28 and came to think about **MY** year and decided I was going to write something.

<!-- more -->

Doing this as quickly as possible while my 7 months old is sleeping and my girlfriend is finishing all preparations before we leave home to meet the families.


To sum up this has been a great year with all of ups and downs:

1. First of all I became a dadâ€¦ which was a wish of my own since forever; thankfully this year was the year we decided to try and luckily were able to give birth to a beautiful and healthy boy named Lucca.
2. Was able to talk (via Twitter; email and even a long Skype call) with [Orta][orta] and [Ash Furrow][ash]; which, to me at least, are 2 great individuals and extremely brilliant ones if I might add; that IMHO are leading the programming path towards where we should be focusing.
This lead to me writing more and better tests in my apps, playing with some `Ruby` and also finally enabling and making sense of `FBSnapshotTesting`.
3. Got the opportunity to help with one of [Felix Krause][krause]'s tools; [sigh](https://github.com/krausefx/sigh); was nice to finally get to help in one `OSS` project that's being used by multiple developers around the world.
4. Expanded my mind by playing around with `Ruby`, `Rails`, `Grape` (all of this kind of the same), `Swift` and finally after a lot of time wanting, `Haskell`. This lead me to expand my horizon and makes me think of how to best implement `Functional Programming` into my `Swift` programs.



Stepping back might not seem like a big deal but it actually was.
As for next year's resolutions; here they are:

1. Finally devote more time to my writing (this blog for example) since I've been delaying it for quite some time now and I really enjoy doing this.
2. Keep on pushing my limits, learning, contributing and exchanging words with as many great devs as I can.
3. Hopefully got the chance to finally work with one of the big companies out there ([Artsy][artsy] I'm looking at you xD)
4. Get to spend a proper amount of time with `CatNip`; a great product [Andrea][andrea] and I have been thinking about for quite some time and it kind of relates with [BeerGram](https://twitter.com/getbeergram) and *CraftKollective*



All in all a __**GREAT**__ year; can't wait to see what next one will have in store for me but I do know what I have in store for it :)
