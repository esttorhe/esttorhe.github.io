Hi; my name is **Esteban Torres** and I'm an `iOS` developer from rainy **Costa Rica**; moved to Berlin to work @ [`SoundCloud`][soundcloud].

You can find a (hopefully updated) version of my `CV` [here][cv]

I love innovation and I'm usually an early adopter whenever I can which, more times than none, has bitten me in the ass.
<!-- more -->
Mostly wander around `Cocoa` & `Cocoa Touch` "realms" but lately I've been trying to expand towards `Ruby`, `Rails` and obviously `Swift`.
I really **LOVE** _OSS_ and at times try to contribute as much as possible and try to get involved with the community; some times though I find myself too overwhelmed with a lot of projects and thus tend to distance myself for some months.

I try to be active in conferences but only if I can find a topic I'm super passionate about; try to avoid giving hollow talks just for the sake of giving talks.

You can find me on GitHub and pretty much always lurkin on Twitter here [@esttorhe](https://twitter.com/esttorhe)
