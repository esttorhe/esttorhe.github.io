Hi; my name is **Esteban Torres** and I'm an `Engineering Manager` @ [`SoundCloud`][soundcloud], Berlin.
I'm originally from ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·Costa Rica where I started as an `Engineer` and quickly jumped on the `iOS` badwagon; this led me to land a job as an `iOS` @ [`SoundCloud`][soundcloud] which of course led to me & my family moving to ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

At [`SoundCloud`][soundcloud] I've worn many hats:

- `iOS` Engineer (`Listening Cluster` and later on `Core Clients`)
- `Cross Platform` Engineer (`Core Clients` were I got to do `Scala`, `Go`, some `Production Engineering`, `iOS` & `Android` development, etc)
- And most recently `Engineering Management`

I used to be moderately active in the `iOS` community and tried to attend different conferences (as an attendee as well as an speaker) but has since a couple of years slowed down a lot in that front.

~~Given my background I'm still figuring out my new role as an `EM` where every day brings a lot of learnings and more than one failure from my part. It is super exciting as there's no dull day; which also makes it tiring due to the constant changes; never know what to expect and the best tool I have is being able to adapt to whatever the situation throws at me.~~

It's been 2 years since I started working as an `Engineering Manager` and lots of things have happened:

- Managed to help a former member of my team transition to a different team where they could grow even more and exert a bigger and wider impact
- Had to manage one of the biggest projects the company (`SoundCloud`) had seen, involving multiple teams, contractors and all 3 major clients
- Took over a 2nd team, which focuses mainly on `Back End Engineering Productivity`

It is fair to say I'm still figuring out things on the new role, but the day-to-day has changed from "I have no idea what I am doing" to "I have no idea what I am doing, but I've seen this before". Looking forward to growing more on this new chapter, although I haven't stopped coding, mainly in `Go` and very recently started learning `Rust`.

I've been jotting down what I learn in a good old paper notebook which I'll try to migrate to a more modern place in this website.
