Hi; my name is **Esteban Torres** and I'm an `Engineering Manager` @ [`SoundCloud`][soundcloud], Berlin.
I'm originally from ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·Costa Rica where I started as an `Engineer` and quickly jumped on the `iOS` badwagon; this led me to land a job as an `iOS` @ [`SoundCloud`][soundcloud] which of course led to me & my family moving to ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

At [`SoundCloud`][soundcloud] I've worn many hats:

- `iOS` Engineer (`Listening Cluster` and later on `Core Clients`)
- `Cross Platform` Engineer (`Core Clients` were I got to do `Scala`, `Go`, some `Production Engineering`, `iOS` & `Android` development, etc)
- And most recently `Engineering Management`

I used to be moderately active in the `iOS` community and tried to attend different conferences (as an attendee as well as an speaker) but has since a couple of years slowed down a lot in that front.

Given my background I'm still figuring out my new role as an `EM` where every day brings a lot of learninsg and more than one failure from my part. It is super exciting as there's no dull day; which also makes it tiring due to the constant changes; never konw what to expect and the best tool I have is being able to adapt to whatever the situation throws at me.

I've been jotting down what I learn in a good old paper notebook which I'll try to migrate to a more modern place in this website.

You can find me on [{{< awesome fa fa-github >}}`GitHub`][github] and [{{< awesome fa fa-twitter >}}`Twitter`][twitter] as `@esttorhe`.
