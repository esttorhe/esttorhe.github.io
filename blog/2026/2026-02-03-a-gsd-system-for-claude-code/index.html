<h2 id="i-have-a-problem-with-unstructured-ai-assisted-coding">I have a Problem with Unstructured AI-Assisted Coding</h2>
<p>When GitHub Copilot rolled out, I found it a new paradigm, though it quickly revealed limitations. Cursor offered a brighter future until context limits emerged. Then, a friend introduced me to Claude Code, and it was a whole new experience.</p>
<p>My productivity skyrocketed, and I quickly hit daily and weekly limits, pushing its bounds. However, I soon realized that jumping into coding so fast was not sustainable.</p>
<p>I have always been someone that reads on a topic, learns the foundations and then properly learns by doing; that meant jumping to an IDE really fast and trying things until they fully clicked.</p>
<p>With AI-assisted coding, that approach was no longer sufficient. Clear specs, proper documentation, and detailed requirements became essential. I started doing that, but there was not a clear way to keep it reproducible the way I needed it to be.</p>
<p>While I was fast at trying new things, the bottleneck was me going back and forth polishing the outcomes not matching my expectations. I got better and better and detailed what I needed to increase exponentially the success of the AI assisted code; but there was still a critical element that needed addressing.</p>
<p>As I was scrolling through different apps, I landed on LinkedIn to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/girish-s-16b4b91a6_claudecode-aiagents-devtools-activity-7416057263422988288-6X5m">this post: Claude Workflow Upgrade with GSD</a>. I read the idea, and it sounded interesting, resonating with me.</p>
<p>The tool is <code>Getting Shit Done</code> , which is a spec-driven development tool for AI assisted development. It relies heavily on people getting &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; and reaching proper spec documents for the assistant to execute. From the <code>README</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.</p>
<p>The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work and verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-is-for">Who This Is For</h2>
<p>People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they&rsquo;re running a 50-person engineering org.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated deeply with me but I was deep into other projects and couldn&rsquo;t simply take the time that this new tool deserved to see if it would work for me or not.</p>
<h2 id="testing-out-gsd">Testing out GSD</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always hoarded articles, trying various apps before self-hosting <a href="https://karakeep.app/">Karakeep</a> on a Raspberry Pi. After an upgrade bricked the database, I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to fix it.</p>
<p>I quickly switched to <a href="https://github.com/Hyaxia/blogwatcher">BlogWatcher</a> running on a local server/computer, which works great. However, I lacked a GUI to navigate the articles, presenting the perfect opportunity to finally test <a href="https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done">GSD</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gsd-system-in-practice">GSD System in Practice</h3>
<p>I started with a blank canvas; I created a <code>.reference</code> folder where I dumped the source code from <a href="https://github.com/Hyaxia/blogwatcher">blogwatcher</a>, I grabbed some reference images of UI I liked and dumped them in the reference folder and kicked a new <code>Claude Code</code> session.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions of the <a href="https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done">gsd</a> documentation and started with:</p>
<p>Now this is where the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; happens. The tool will start &ldquo;quizzing&rdquo; you about your goals, the codebase, etc; you can then choose to do research, planning and verification. It will let you know that you&rsquo;ll be using more tokens during these phases, but I think most of them are worth it.</p>
<p>Once you answer the setup questions, you receive a roadmap and plan. The tool will split the work in phases, you get to confirm if that looks correct, etc and at the end you&rsquo;ll have a planning document as well as a roadmap. And you are ready to go.</p>
<p>After the initial plan is laid out, you can start researching or planning phase 1. Work cannot begin until the phase is planned. Planning lays out a proper &lsquo;prompt plan&rsquo; for the AI assistant to follow and execute. After that, it&rsquo;s autopilot with strong guardrails.</p>
<p>I let the assistant do its thing and whenever a phase was ready I would launch and verify that things were working accordingly. The code generated for each phase was functionally correct on the first execution, requiring only minor stylistic tweaks.</p>
<p>I tested it with a relatively simple project, which proved to be a great initial validation. While I was impressed by the structured process, its performance on a more complex, multi-faceted project remains to be seen.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes-and-personal-reflections">Outcomes and Personal Reflections</h2>
<p>At the end of a single &ldquo;coding&rdquo; session I was left with a product that satisfies my needs. The <a href="https://github.com/esttorhe/blogwatcher-ui">BlogWatcher UI</a>. The plans and roadmaps are left in the code-base (as suggested by the tool) and I believe they are a great way to document how the project came to be in case I need to touch this in the future (or another AI assistant does).</p>
<p>I enjoyed the thorough planning and careful execution. The token expenditure is no joke, but I believe it is a worthwhile investment. In my experience, it likely prevents the higher cumulative token cost and wasted time on multiple failed attempts often associated with less structured methods.</p>
<p>Now, after this first test, I have a better sense of which phases are essential and which can be streamlined. For example, on a project where the architecture is already clear, I might condense the &lsquo;research&rsquo; phase while always retaining the detailed &lsquo;planning&rsquo; phase, which I found delivered the most value. I&rsquo;ll definitely be using the tool again in the future and will keep iterating on the workflow.</p>
<p>For any developer looking to improve the reliability and structure of their AI-assisted work, I believe trying this system is a valuable exercise. Even if the tool isn&rsquo;t for you, it will hopefully instill the habit of proper specification for AI-assisted coding or even your own coding sessions.</p>
