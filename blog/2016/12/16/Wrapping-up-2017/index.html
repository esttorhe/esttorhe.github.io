    	<p>I’ve been away for quite some time now and a lot of things have changed since I last had the time to blog.</p>
<p>I’ll try to detail everything that has happened in my life in the past few months and also prepare for my yearly wrap-up post.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Brewbot-🍺🤖"><a href="#Brewbot-🍺🤖" class="headerlink" title="Brewbot 🍺🤖"></a><code>Brewbot</code> 🍺🤖</h1><p>Last time I blogged I was working for <a href="https://brewbot.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Brewbot</code></a> and living in 🇨🇷 (I’ll cover this part later).<br>Sadly things went south and as many startups ended up belly up…</p>
<p>Details about how or why that happened are not importante honestly and I won’t dwell too much into it; let’s summarize it by saying that after I got the 👢I had to look for different options to keep my family and 🏠 afloat.</p>
<p>I worked for a couple of months with a friend on his company and then jumped to yet another agency for the time being.</p>
<p>All of this was just temporarily because while I was at <a href="https://estebantorr.es/blog/2016/06/03/iOScon-2016/">iOScon</a> I bumped into Pedro; an <code>iOS</code> developer from <code>SoundCloud</code> that I’ve met on <code>Twitter</code> before and who told me that <code>SoundCloud</code> was looking for <code>iOS</code> engineers if I was interested.</p>
<p>The idea was interesting and exciting but I was enjoying what I was doing at the time… that was until the day before I was due to give my talk when I was informed that yet again I was not going to get paid… and then I decided to start my process with <code>SoundCloud</code>.</p>
<h4 id="TL-DR-version"><a href="#TL-DR-version" class="headerlink" title="TL;DR version"></a>TL;DR version</h4><p>I joined <code>SoundCloud</code> on October the 1st…</p>
<h1 id="Relocation"><a href="#Relocation" class="headerlink" title="Relocation"></a>Relocation</h1><p>During the whole interview process me and my (by then girlfriend, wife now) discussed a lot about the implications of actually getting hired by <code>SoundCloud</code>; like having to relocate to 🇩🇪 for example.</p>
<p>After discussing all the pros and cons we were on board in case we ended up in that situation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spoiler alert</em></strong><br>We ended up in that situation 😝<br>The visa process wasn’t hard but wasn’t smooth either due to the fact that I was the first costarrican to be relocated to 🇩🇪 by <code>SoundCloud</code> and that prooved a little bit harder than anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="Hunting-for-an-apartment-🔫"><a href="#Hunting-for-an-apartment-🔫" class="headerlink" title="Hunting for an apartment 🔫"></a>Hunting for an apartment 🔫</h3><p>I’m not going to go into lots of details here… suffice to say that looking for the right apartment… scratch that; for <strong>A</strong> apartment is surprisingly hard in Berlin… given that this is a city with a lot of movement, people coming and going the demand is high and getting an apartment felt like applying for a job… for your <em>first</em> job…</p>
<p>You try to give them a great impression (hard to do so given that you only talk with the real state agent while you are looking at the apartment with another 20 or so people…).<br>Is hard to make a lasting good impression under this circumstances.</p>
<p>It took us 2 months and a lot of frustration but we were able to get a nice apartment in Prenzlauer Berg 🎉</p>
<p>Now I get to come to the office riding my 🚲 (As a side note… I came to the realisation that I haven’t ridden a bike since I was 15 or so… 😭 I’m feeling it 😂)</p>
<h1 id="OSS-amp-Conferences"><a href="#OSS-amp-Conferences" class="headerlink" title="OSS &amp; Conferences"></a>OSS &amp; Conferences</h1><p>During the beginning of this year I had my mind and heart set on giving many conferences and contributing as much as possible with <code>OSS</code> projects (mine and others).</p>
<p>I accomplished both of those resolutions to the point that I spoke at 3 different conferences pretty far away from home.</p>
<ol>
<li>iOScon • London, UK</li>
<li>NSSpain • Logroño, Spain</li>
<li>Mobilization • Łódź, Poland</li>
</ol>
<p>And got involved in many different <code>OSS</code> projects.</p>
<h2 id="Now"><a href="#Now" class="headerlink" title="Now"></a>Now</h2><p>That being said I think I’m going to step down from <code>OSS</code> for a while and will apply to far less conferences this year.</p>
<p>Reasoning for this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I’m trying too hard to come up with nice and interesting topics for conferences… this shouldn’t be the case. I should be talking about stuff that I’m passionate about or that I like.<br>I have one more topic I would love to talk about so I’ll try to make it to at least one conference in 2017 where I’ll hopefully be able to talk about this topic 😄</li>
<li>I’ve stretched myself too thin trying to reach into a lot of <code>OSS</code> projects and lately I’ve not been able to provide a decent response neither in time nor in quality; also given that now I have to commute I don’t have as much «free» time and the one that I have I’m spending it playing with my son as much as I can while he still enjoys it 😄<br>I want to apologize to all those maintainers of projects where I’ve been given the responsability to help maintain the project; I’ll stay as a supporter and will try to help every now and then but I won’t be as devoted to it as I tried during the first half of the year.</li>
</ul>
