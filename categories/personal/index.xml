      <description>Sudden realisation Early last year (2019) I came to the realisation that I needed a change… I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding for a long time, doing iOS for the biggest part of my career, and at some point (even though I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself an “expert”) it started to becomed a bit dull.
This was not for a lack of challenges, as there was always something new, e.g.:SwiftUI, Combine, Marzipan, iPadOS, you name it; but at one point or the other it lost some of the spark ✨</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been away for quite some time now and a lot of things have changed since I last had the time to blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to detail everything that has happened in my life in the past few months and also prepare for my yearly wrap-up post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: 2015</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/esttorhe/2015-Resolutions&#34;&gt;list of resolutions&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://estebantorr.es/blog/2014/12/2014-12-31-new-year-resolutions/&#34;&gt;blogged about it&lt;/a&gt;; overall it was a great year; completed almost all my resolutions and had the chance to grow &lt;strong&gt;A LOT&lt;/strong&gt; professionally (or so I think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small round down of my previous year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got turned down by &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.com&#34;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;: Basically applied to &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.com&#34;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and everything went OK but I suck at interviews; I think I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to sell myself properly and was turned down.
&lt;br/&gt;No hard feelings though, they felt I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for the team and they got to do what&amp;rsquo;s best for the team.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it safe to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve been «scolded» twice this week due to my technical questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now… I was not &lt;em&gt;scolded&lt;/em&gt; as the word implies but the context was that; and I did deserve it if I&amp;rsquo;m honest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is a «well known» fact that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get to 12% body fat; last year I was really close at 14% but then I ricocheted back to 17% and my mental state took a toll and was not able to get back on track. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going up &amp;amp; down on my body fat since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last December I hit horrible numbers because I pretty much gave up on exercising 💪 and dieting 🌿 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Website</title>
      <link>https://estebantorr.es/blog/2015/06/2015-06-20-new-website/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;«Clearly» the site has changed (as long as you have been following me; if not then perhaps this is «shocking news» for you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the blog with &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and quickly «moved» to &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Octopress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for its «simplicity» to make new posts, pages and change themes; or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time having to deal with it and then having to create a blog for &lt;a href=&#34;http://lognllc.github.io&#34;&gt;Log(n)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s employees (being that I&amp;rsquo;m one of them at the moment) gave me some insights as to how convoluted the process is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got the opportunity to read Ash Furrow&amp;rsquo;s post about his 5 years doing iOS development and read (as much as I could from my phone) Orta&amp;rsquo;s blog about his 28 and came to think about MY year and decided I was going to write something.
Doing this as quickly as possible while my 7 months old is sleeping and my girlfriend is finishing all preparations before we leave home to meet the families.</description>
