Hi; my name is **Esteban Torres** and I'm an `iOS` developer from rainy **Costa Rica**.

I love innovation and I'm usually an early adopter whenever I can which, more times than none, has bitten me in the ass.

Mostly wander around `Cocoa` & `Cocoa Touch` "realms" but lately I've been trying to expand towards `Ruby`, `Rails` and obviously `Swift`.
Consider myself a [`CocoaPods`](http://cocoapods.org) "evangelist" since I first knew about them and have a few `pods` of my own. (You can check them on my [`GitHub` profile](https://github.com/esttorhe)).

I'll try to keep an up to date "journal" on this `iOS` journey from a country located in the middle of a continent (no kidding; fire up [GoogleMaps](http://maps.google.com/) and look for Costa Rica).

You can find me on GitHub and pretty much always lurkin on Twitter here [@esttorhe](https://twitter.com/esttorhe)
