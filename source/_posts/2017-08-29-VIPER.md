First of all; this is not «_Yet another [VIPER][viper] blog post_»*™* but more like «_What did I learn while trying [VIPER][viper]_» kind of blog post.

That being said; we can't jump straight into [`VIPER`][viper] without giving it at least a small introduction; so here's the definition given by [mutualmobile][mutualmobile] (allegedly `VIPER`s creators):

> **VIPER** is our application of _Clean Architecture_ to iOS apps. The word **VIPER** is a backronym for _View_, _Interactor_, _Presenter_, _Entity_ and _Routing_.
>
>  &mdash; <cite>[Jeff Gilbert & Conrad Stoll][viper]</cite>

There are many good sources about [`VIPER`][viper] like [this article from obj.io][objio] or [this amazing talk from Nicola Zaghini @ Mobilization][mobilization].
