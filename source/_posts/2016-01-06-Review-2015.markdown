Last year I made a [list of resolutions][resolutions] and also [blogged about it][resolutionsBlog]; overall it was a great year; completed almost all my resolutions and had the chance to grow **A LOT** professionally (or so I think).

A small round down of my previous year:

* Got turned down by [Slack][slack]: Basically applied to [Slack][slack] and everything went OK but I suck at interviews; I think I don't know how to sell myself properly and was turned down.
<br/>No hard feelings though, they felt I wasn't a good fit for the team and they got to do what's best for the team.

<!--more-->
* Changed jobs: I left [`Log(n)`][logn] around September and started working on an AMAZING job 🍻 related called [`Brewbot`][brewbot].
* Travelled to Belfast (new job's HQ are located in Belfast)
* Got to finally meet in person Ash Furrow, Orta, Chris Eidhof, Agnes Vasarhelyi, Veronica Ray among many other great developers.
* Got shortlisted for `SwiftSummit` in San Francisco and even wrote a blog post for them that I think hasn't been publish (will probably release it on my blog)
* Started contributing more to open source; helping with [`RxViewModel`][rxviewmodel], [`RxSwiftCommunity`][rxswiftcommunity], [`Moya`][moya], [`CocoaPods`][cocoapods], [`FBSnapshotTests`][snapshots], [`SwiftGen`][swiftgen], [`SwiftSSH2`][swiftssh2], [DeckRocket][deckrocket], [XcodeServerSDK][xcodeserversdk], [`NaughtyKeyboard`][naughty] and some others which helped me not only learn a lot but to get to know a lot of people from ALL over the world 🌍🌎🌏
* Made a lot of Twitter/Internet friends which I think is one of the MOST amazing things from last year; if you are reading this and you are one of my new interwebz friend: 👋 hello!! Really appreciate being friends with you 😄
* Finally organized a [`CocoaHeads`][cocoaheads] meetup :)
* [`CraftKollective`][ck] started moving again and we are on the path towards generating business!! 🎉
* Configured [Cloudflare][cloudflare] on my website and now is faster and more secure by defaulting to `https` 😄
* Moved to a new house: My girldfriend and I moved to a bigger house, located in a gated community (which is great for when our son starts playing outside with friends) and closer to her family. This is a huge milestone because I wasn't 💯 happy with our previous house.
    * On that note we started renting our previous house to a couple of guys that destroyed it and we are now just wanting to sell it and be done with it.
* My son is healthy and super happy 😄 He's a bright kid and that tires us down super fast ⚡ Its super cool anyways 😄 He'll be starting school in a couple of weeks; can't wait for all the crazy adventures that will come.

After writing all this and re-reading my resolution's from [last year's post][resolutionsBlog] I'm more than happy with how everything turned out. I really LOVE my current job and everyone I work with, also I get to write `Swift` all day long and get paid to do it 🎉

All is left for this year is keep pushing my limits; last year one goal was to submit a topic to a conference, did it; this year is to actually ***GIVE*** a talk 😄

In the horizon there's always the idea to move abroad; we'll see how things pan out.
