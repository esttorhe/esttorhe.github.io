# #iOSGutAtDroidcon
Last week fellow speaker and good friend Jorge Ortiz-Fuentes[^1] wrote me on `Twitter` to tell me he had an extra ticket for `droidcon` Berlin[^2] since he'll be speaking (Now, as you might know I do `iOS` and know close to **NOTHING** about `Android` development) and since I have always been curious about `Android` development I said _YES_ and embarked on what would be my first ever **droidCon**.

As many other conferences it started with a party on Saturday (which I missed) and then on Sunday they opened for badge pickups and workshops (I thought about attending but then figured out that I wouldn't be doing much given my lack of knowledge in the topic, and perhaps I would have been taking the spot from someone that might get more benefit out of it; so I passed) which I didn't attend and thus I «skipped» the «1st» day of the conference.

Monday came and I jumped on the `S42` and then on to the `S5` (this place turned out to be fairly far away from my place) and after 35-45 minutes I reached `CityCube` Berlin[^3].

The keynote was more of a «soft» talk than a technical one and because of that there were a lot of parallels and interesting points exposed by Chiu-Ki Chan[^4] that could easily be applied to `iOS` and any other «community» for that matter.

Once the keynote was done I tried to attend a talk about `Google`'s new persistence framework `Room`[^5] by Florina Muntunescu[^6]; sadly almost everybody else had the same idea and I couldn't pass the door.

Instead go to listen to Marco Cova[^7] from `Facebook` explain with many details how their scale is insane and how their problems are usually non-documented and they end up being the firsts to actually deal with them
