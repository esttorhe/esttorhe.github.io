    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since quite some time now I‚Äôve been working on <code>Xcode</code> projects that are pretty big; big enough to take up a considerable amount of time to finish compiling, even worst if you are running the tests and it needs to build EVERYTHING and then run ALL the tests.</p><p>I also like to multi-task and do some other stuff while I‚Äôm compiling‚Ä¶<br><a href="https://xkcd.com/303/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png" alt="xkcd comic about compilation times"></a></p><a id="more"></a><p>For the longest time I thought about creating some sort of service that would let me hook up some push notifications whenever <code>Xcode</code> finished doing <em>X</em> or <em>Y</em> task but never came around actually creating it. Time passed and I basically forgot all about this dream of mine.</p><p>That is until today when I found out about <a href="https://github.com/dschep/ntfy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ntfy</code></a>‚Ä¶</p><h1 id="ntfy"><a href="#ntfy" class="headerlink" title="ntfy"></a>ntfy</h1><blockquote><p><code>ntfy</code> brings notification to your shell. It can automatically provide desktop notifications when long running commands finish or it can send push notifications to your phone when a specific command finishes.</p></blockquote><p><strong>TL,DR</strong>: <code>ntfy</code> is a <code>python</code> üêç  tool that sends notifications to different configurable backend services.</p><p><strong>TL;DR 2</strong>: <code>ntfy</code> is basically the service I wanted to build and never came around to actually making.</p><h2 id="Installation"><a href="#Installation" class="headerlink" title="Installation"></a>Installation</h2><p>The tool‚Äôs <code>README</code> is pretty nicely done and comes with a <code>Quickstart</code> section that describes how to install it; unfortunately for me it didn‚Äôt work due to some obscure error:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Command &quot;python setup.py egg_info&quot;

Preferences -&gt; Behaviors</em>)</p><p><img src="Xcode_Behaviors.png" alt="Xcode Preferences showing the Behaviors tab"></p><p>At the very bottom of the window there‚Äôs a <code>Run</code> checkbox where you can choose a script/binary that you want to run whenever a behavior happens.</p><p>At first I had 1 script per behavior but then I discovered that there‚Äôs an env variable that gets passed that has all the information I needed.</p><h2 id="Available-variables"><a href="#Available-variables" class="headerlink" title="Available variables"></a>Available variables</h2><p>There are many variables that get passed to the binary/script;

etc.)</p><p>As you can see the see <code>IDEAlertMessage</code> has everything I needed; is just a matter of calling <code>ntfy</code> with the contents of that variable and the <code>Xcode Workspace</code> and then you are set.</p><h2 id="Script"><a href="#Script" class="headerlink" title="Script"></a>Script</h2><p>If you don‚Äôt want to play around this is the contents of my script:</p><p><code>ntfy.sh</code><br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="meta">#! /bin/sh</span></div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">/usr/<span class="built_in">local</span>/bin/ntfy -b telegram send <span class="string">"<span class="variable">$XcodeWorkspace</span> <span class="variable">$IDEAlertMessage</span>"</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p><em>You might have noticed the <code>-b telegram</code> part.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="iOSGutAtDroidcon"><a href="#iOSGutAtDroidcon" class="headerlink" title="#iOSGutAtDroidcon"></a>#iOSGutAtDroidcon</h1><p>Last week fellow speaker and good friend Jorge Ortiz-Fuentes<a href="https://twitter.com/jdortiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^1</a> wrote me on <code>Twitter</code> to tell me he had an extra ticket for <code>droidcon</code> Berlin<a href="http://droidcon.de/en/program/schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^2</a> since he‚Äôll be speaking (Now, as you might know I do <code>iOS</code> and know close to <strong>NOTHING</strong> about <code>Android</code> development) and since I have always been curious about <code>Android</code> development I said <em>YES</em> and embarked on what would be my first ever <strong>droidCon</strong>.</p><a id="more"></a><p>As many other conferences it started with a party on Saturday (which I missed) and then on Sunday they opened for badge pickups and workshops (I thought about attending but then figured out that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing much given my lack of knowledge in the topic, and perhaps I would have been taking the spot from someone that might get more benefit out of it; so I passed) which I didn‚Äôt attend and thus I ¬´skipped¬ª the ¬´1st¬ª day of the conference.</p><h2 id="Kick-off"><a href="#Kick-off" class="headerlink" title="Kick-off!"></a>Kick-off!</h2><p>Monday came and I jumped on the <code>S42</code> and then on to the <code>S5</code> (this place turned out to be fairly far away from my place) and after 35-45 minutes I reached <code>CityCube</code> Berlin<a href="http://www.messe-berlin.de/de/Veranstalter/UnsereLocations/CityCubeBerlin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^3</a>.</p><p>The keynote was more of a ¬´soft¬ª talk than a technical one and because of that there were a lot of parallels and interesting points exposed by Chiu-Ki Chan<a href="http://blog.sqisland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^4</a> that could easily be applied to <code>iOS</code> and any other ¬´community¬ª for that matter.</p><h2 id="Failing-but-keep-trying"><a href="#Failing-but-keep-trying" class="headerlink" title="Failing but keep trying"></a>Failing but keep trying</h2><p>Once the keynote was done I tried to attend a talk about <code>Google</code>‚Äòs new persistence framework <code>Room</code><a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^5</a> by Florina Muntunescu<a href="https://medium.com/@florina.muntenescu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^6</a>; sadly almost everybody else had the same idea and I couldn‚Äôt get past the door.</p><p>Instead got to listen to Marco Cova<a href="http://droidcon.de/en/users/marco-cova#profile-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^7</a> from <code>Facebook</code> explain with many details how their scale is insane and how their problems are usually non-documented and they end up being the first to actually deal and solve them (like the <code>DEX</code> file<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^8</a> limit problem for example).</p><h2 id="Learning-about-Dagger-2"><a href="#Learning-about-Dagger-2" class="headerlink" title="Learning about Dagger 2"></a>Learning about <code>Dagger</code> 2</h2><p>Garima Jain<a href="https://medium.com/@ragdroid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^9</a> talked about the new and shiny <code>Dagger</code> 2 as a resource to help overcome the dependency injection hell and how this version differs from the 1st incarnation of it.<br>Unfortunately for me, although the topic was <strong>SUPER</strong> interesting, I felt it was too knee-deep for someone with <strong><em>ZERO</em></strong> knowledge of <code>Android</code> development, and thus, couldn‚Äôt follow all the nitty-gritty benefits; but the gist of it sounded like a really useful and interesting tool.</p><h2 id="Day-1-coming-to-an-end"><a href="#Day-1-coming-to-an-end" class="headerlink" title="Day 1; coming to an end"></a>Day 1; coming to an end</h2><p>As the day drew to an end, Xavier F. Gouchet<a href="https://twitter.com/xgouchet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^10</a> talked about an interesting topic (at least really interesting to me) regarding how test coverage doesn‚Äôt necessarily means you are really testing your code appropiately (or even covering correctly your cases).<br>He presented a ¬´tool¬ª (specifically a <code>Gradle</code> plugin<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^11</a>) that ¬´mutates¬ª sentences in your code (not your source code) to verify that variation in the sentences are actually catched in your tests; simply put, you ¬´test your tests¬ª by changing different operations (sentences) and verifying that your tests are actually detecting; if not then a ¬´mutation¬ª is flagged and you then can properly add a test to cover this scenario.<br>With this approach you can be sure that your tests are properly testing all possible paths and variations.<br>To me this was a really interesting talk, probably my favorite of the whole conference.</p><h2 id="Day-2-here-we-go-again"><a href="#Day-2-here-we-go-again" class="headerlink" title="Day 2; here we go again"></a>Day 2; here we go again</h2><p>The next day had one of the talks I was really interested in attending, <code>Kotlin</code> Coroutines by Svetlana Isakova<a href="http://droidcon.de/en/%40sveta_isakova" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^12</a>.<br>I‚Äôve been hearing so much about <code>Kotlin</code> that I wanted to finally see some of its power.<br><code>Coroutines</code> (at least from what I grasped during this talk) could somehow have a parallelism with <code>NSBlockOperations</code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/blockoperation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^13</a>.<br>Not 100% equivalence but they do have some sort of mechanism to ¬´dispatch¬ª them, they do have some sort of ¬´suspend¬ª mechanism (which actually sets the entry point for a function to be ¬´suspended¬ª and not halting the executing of the app) and get to deliver results at their own times.</p><h2 id="Or-maybe-not‚Ä¶"><a href="#Or-maybe-not‚Ä¶" class="headerlink" title="Or maybe not‚Ä¶"></a>Or maybe not‚Ä¶</h2><p>Even though the day was beginning I couldn‚Äôt find a talk that catched my attention (if you keep in mind that I was selecting them based solely on the small description and most of them didn‚Äôt even begin to make sense to me) I went to roam around the booths and also visited the <code>IFA</code><a href="http://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^14</a> where I got to see some pretty interesting appliances, tried <code>Samsung</code>‚Äòs <code>VR</code> system and collected an insane amount of freebies that everyone was giving away.</p><h2 id="Thoughts"><a href="#Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts?"></a>Thoughts?</h2><p>From my experience (and that of some of other attendeeds I talked with) there is some room for improvement regarding the organization of the conference.<br>Some quick rundown of the ones I can remember</p><ol><li>Some of the rooms felt totally disconnected from the conference</li><li>The Q&amp;A after each session was not properly handled and due to the ¬´multi track¬ª style of the conference most attendees got up and started leaving while the questions were being asked and the speakers were answering; to me this feels a little bit disrespecful to the speaker and even to the people asking questions</li><li>Sharing space and time with <code>IFA</code><a href="http://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^14</a>. Even though it was nice for me because I could disconnect every now and then and relax from a conference related to something I don‚Äôt do this caused a lot of ¬´noise¬ª, lots of people not related to the conference coming and going through <code>droidCon</code> (literally walking through it) which felt weird; also this might have been detrimental to the attendance of some talks (I noticed a few attendees leaving <code>droidCon</code> to visit <code>IFA</code><a href="http://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">^14</a>)</li></ol><p>All in all I enjoyed <code>droidCon</code> Berlin, and who knows; might not be my last.<br>I have plans of start dabbling a little on <code>Kotlin</code> so perhaps this is the perfect excuse and initial push for me.</p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;A small round down of my previous year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got turned down by &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;: Basically applied to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and everything went OK but I suck at interviews; I think I don‚Äôt know how to sell myself properly and was turned down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No hard feelings though, they felt I wasn‚Äôt a good fit for the team and they got to do what‚Äôs best for the team.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that you can rightfully assume that I‚Äôm migrating all my &lt;code&gt;Result&amp;lt;T,U&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; code to support &lt;code&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; instead, on my &lt;code&gt;2.0&lt;/code&gt; branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might know (or not) whenever you do a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block needs to be exhaustive; just like a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; and ¬´catch¬ª &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; possible paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn‚Äôt mean you &lt;strong&gt;necessarily&lt;/strong&gt; need to specify every single error type in your &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block (even though ideally you should react differently for each type of error) but you can add an exhaustive &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; that will represent ¬´every single error¬ª.&lt;/p&gt;

hitting a ‚Äúshare‚Äù button was yielding no actions‚Ä¶</p><p>That‚Äôs weird since we have it ‚Äúwired‚Äù to launch a <code>UIActivityController</code> that will handle our sharing list.</p><p>Let‚Äôs open <code>Xcode</code> and launch the simulator‚Ä¶ nope, everything works as expected.</p><p>Time to connect our device;

it is <code>nil</code>; but not just that; the child view controller is being presented <strong>modally</strong>‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ <code>iOS</code> somewhere is taking the child view controller out of its hierarchy and its presenting it completely isolated as a ‚Äúmodal‚Äù leaving the user stuck (because it was coded assuming a <code>Back</code> button on <code>UINavigationBar</code> added after the push).</p><h1 id="But-WHY-‚Ä¶"><a href="#But-WHY-‚Ä¶" class="headerlink" title="But WHY??‚Ä¶"></a>But <strong>WHY??</strong>‚Ä¶</h1><p>I went to Apple‚Äôs documentation regarding this new ‚Äúadaptive segues‚Äù (because if you didn‚Äôt know <code>Push</code>, <code>Modal</code>, <code>Popover</code> &amp;

throw a <code>UINavigationController</code>; set its <code>rootViewController</code>, one <code>UIButton</code>, connect its action to <code>Show</code> and that to another <code>UIViewController</code>; now lets create some code for that child view controller that should display a <code>UIActivityController</code> upon <code>viewDidAppear:</code>:</p><figure class="highlight objc"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">- (<span class="keyword">void</span>)viewDidAppear:(<span class="built_in">BOOL</span>)animated &#123;</div><div class="line">    [<span class="keyword">super</span> viewDidAppear:animated];</div><div class="line">    </div><div class="line">    <span class="built_in">UIActivityViewController</span> *activityVC = [[<span class="built_in">UIActivityViewController</span> alloc] initWithActivityItems:@[<span class="string">@"Test"</span>]</div><div class="line">                                                                             applicationActivities:<span class="literal">nil</span>];</div><div class="line">    [<span class="keyword">self</span>.navigationController presentViewController:activityVC animated:<span class="literal">YES</span> completion:^&#123;</div><div class="line">        <span class="built_in">NSLog</span>(<span class="string">@"This line will never execute on iOS 7.1"</span>);</div><div class="line">    &#125;];</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And voil√†; compile and run on <code>iOS8</code>; everything works.</p><p>Close, compile and run on <code>iOS7</code>‚Ä¶ everything works.</p><p><strong>YES</strong>‚Ä¶ no wait‚Ä¶ the code is working correctly on both environments. Cleaning and building again did not introduce the issue. </p><h1 id="Consistently-Reproducing-The-Bug"><a href="#Consistently-Reproducing-The-Bug" class="headerlink" title="Consistently Reproducing The Bug"></a>Consistently Reproducing The Bug</h1><p>I was just about to give hope on this when I remembered something. In our project we have a ‚Äúhamburger‚Äù menu (something for another post) which ‚Äúreplaces‚Äù the top view controller via code before using all the segues from the storyboard.</p><p>Perhaps that‚Äôs the issue; let‚Äôs make a couple of modifications.</p><p>First let‚Äôs add an ‚Äúextra‚Äù level on our storyboards; so that we now have something like this:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">--- UINavigationController</div><div class="line">    --- Root View Controller</div><div class="line">    --- Pushed 1st View Controller // Via Code</div><div class="line">    --- Pushed 2nd View Controller // Via `Show` segue</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And from the 1st view controller let‚Äôs push the 2nd one with some boilerplate code:</p><figure class="highlight objc"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="built_in">UIViewController</span> *vc = </div><div class="line">[<span class="keyword">self</span>.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:<span class="string">@"ViewController"</span>];</div><div class="line">[<span class="keyword">self</span>.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:<span class="literal">YES</span>];</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Compile and run on <code>iOS8</code> everything works</p><p><img src="iOS8.png" alt=""></p><p> close compile and run on <code>iOS7</code> and‚Ä¶ there you go.<br><img src="iOS7.png" alt=""></p><p>Last <code>UIViewController</code> is being presented modally instead of pushed to the current stack; thus, its <code>navigationController</code> property is <code>nil</code>.</p><p>#Conclusion<br>This is obviously a bug introduced by Apple that does not support ‚Äúretro compatiblity‚Äù of this new <code>adaptative segues</code>.</p><p>We should be able to replace the deprecated <code>Push</code> with this <code>Show</code> and it should behave the same unless we are taking advantage of this whole new ‚Äúmaster/detail‚Äù containers approach.</p><p>I filed a <a href="http://www.openradar.me/19259764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radar</a> with this issue, please feel free to duplicate with that hopes that Apple fixes it.</p><p>Also <a href="https://github.com/esttorhe/ShowNotWorking_Radar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here‚Äôs the code</a> with a project that easily reproduces the issue.</p><p>#Workaround<br>For now the only ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is changing the <code>Show</code> segue for a <code>Deprecated</code> <code>Push</code>; this looks like (and <strong><em>is</em></strong> ) code smell but its the only viable solution for now.</p><h1 id="UPDATE"><a href="#UPDATE" class="headerlink" title="UPDATE"></a>UPDATE</h1><p>Recently I got an update on my radar from Ô£ø with the following response:</p><blockquote><p>Adaptive segues like Show are only supported when running on iOS 8 or later. Interface Builder is failing to warn that this segue will not be properly unarchived on iOS 7.</p><p>We are continuing to work on this issue, and will follow up with you again.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it; Ô£ø kind of accepted it as a bug (at least on IB not warning) but at the same time is telling us that pre <code>iOS8</code> adaptative segues could have unexpected behavior.</p><p>Long story short; <em>DON‚ÄôT USE THEM</em> if you need to support older OS versions.</p>]]></content>

&lt;h1 id=&quot;Fist-Glimpse-Of-The-Problem&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Fist-Glimpse-Of-The-Problem&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Fist Glimpse Of The Problem&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fist Glimpse Of The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this ‚Äúembracing the change‚Äù would come to hunts us with a weird bug that was reported to us; hitting a ‚Äúshare‚Äù button was yielding no actions‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs weird since we have it ‚Äúwired‚Äù to launch a &lt;code&gt;UIActivityController&lt;/code&gt; that will handle our sharing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs open &lt;code&gt;Xcode&lt;/code&gt; and launch the simulator‚Ä¶ nope, everything works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to connect our device; load the latest build, run and‚Ä¶ nope, can‚Äôt reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
